# hello-GitHub

My first GitHub Repository

My name is Nathan; I am currently (as of 2017-09-16 2:55PM MST) learning the ways of GitHub.
I am a mechanical engineer with no idea how this will contribute toward my career, but I have a feeling it could be useful for pet projects.

I learned to code in C++, and I am currently finding ways to make Python useful for automating aspects of my job.

Recently, I got git.

To say that it has changed the way I program is a statement. Might be understating or overstating certain aspects, but
nonetheless, it changes how I view making changes, breaking changes, and working with others.
I had no idea it would be so useful, and I'm excited to see where it all goes from here.
