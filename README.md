# hello-GitHub

My first GitHub Repository

My name is Nathan; I am currently (as of 2017-09-16 2:55PM MST) learning the ways of GitHub.
I am a mechanical engineer with no idea how this will contribute toward my career, but I have a feeling it could be useful for pet projects.

I learned to code in C++, and I am currently finding ways to make Python useful for automating aspects of my job.
